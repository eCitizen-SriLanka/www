          <p class="animated fadeInUp">We are a citizen’s movement focused on democratizing democracy in Sri Lanka by empowering our people using innovation & technology. </p>

  <p class="animated fadeInUp">Together, we will create a movement to allow us to stay engaged to protect ourselves from the tyranny of the corrupt few.</p>

<p class="animated fadeInUp smalltext">We will achieve that by addressing the problems in our system.</p>

<p class="animated fadeInUp smalltext">We are not about an individual. We are not political party. Instead, we will be a societal force through which the engine of democracy can run: we want to make sure the system works the way it is  supposed to!</p>

      <h2>Be a platform for citizen engagement</h2>
<p>Sri Lanka’s citizens do not get much opportunity to participate in guiding our trajectory. “Public consultations” are not open or transparent, especially on follow up. We want to build technology platforms to empower people to take part in policy definitions, policy reviews, provide feedback and engage in facilitation of transparency.</p>  
<p>Technology allows us to build a much more accessible and massively scalable engagement approach for every citizen. </p>
