# eCitizens Movement - Who are we? 
We are a citizen’s movement focused on democratizing democracy in Sri Lanka by empowering our people using innovation & technology. 

Together, we will create a movement to allow us to stay engaged to protect ourselves from the tyranny of the corrupt few.

We will achieve that by addressing the problems in our system.

We are not about an individual. We are not political party. Instead, we will be a societal force through which the engine of democracy can run: we want to make sure the system works the way it is supposed to!

# Our Vision
Change the political, social and economic landscape of Sri Lanka to create a more equal, transparent and humane society.

Sri Lanka will be a country of people who are considered the happiest in the world, live in harmony with each other and with nature, have excellent social care and infrastructure, are content with their lives and are improving the world by exporting our positive approach to life.

# Our intents 
We aim to establish a more equitable, transparent and responsible government that genuinely works in the best interests of all people in our country and not for the interests of the few.

We want to widely adopt innovative technology to improve efficiency and create unprecedented transparency to fight corruption and abuse of power.

We will improve people’s dignity by creating a governance culture where all citizens are equal and where no one is considered above anyone else, legally or by practices.

We will create a disciplined nation that upholds law and order and works hard to improve our nation for the overall betterment of the world.

# How will we achieve our goals?
1. Build a large digitally engaged membership
2. Create a system for better candidates for election to come out
3. Identify, recruit, mentor and develop leaders for institutions
4. Help practice innovation & adopt technology in institutions
5. Use data to monitor, observe and become a watchdog for the people to prevent the government from becoming big brother
6. Use the law to proactively defend people’s interests
7. Be a platform for global engagement to develop strategy and plans for Sri Lanka’s future


# Characteristics of a better candidate
* Accountability
* Transparency
* Integrity
* Not corruptible
* Independent thinker
* Long term thinker
* Thinking patriotically about nation
* Qualified & experienced as necessary

# Be a platform for citizen engagement
Sri Lanka’s citizens do not get much opportunity to participate in guiding our trajectory. “Public consultations” are not open or transparent, especially on follow up. We want to build technology platforms to empower people to take part in policy definitions, policy reviews, provide feedback and engage in facilitation of transparency.  
Technology allows us to build a much more accessible and massively scalable engagement approach for every citizen. 

# What can you do to help?
* Review, refine policies and strategy 
* Contribute as a subject matter expert to refine sectors within strategy goals 
* Design, implement technology projects
* Development project planning and leadership at ground level 
* Community building
* Marketing, messaging, media campaign planning and execution 
* Language translation and content generation and curation 
* Be an active movement member, advocacy and promotion 
* Movement champions 
* Principles guardians
